Overview:
Frotz
- Frotz is a Z-Machine interpreter for playing Infocom
  games and other text-based adventure games
- ZeroSlackr uses both the ncurses and dumb targets.
  Sound support is added but not tested.
For more information, see:
- http://frotz.homeunix.org/frotz/
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine

Usage:
- Terminal launch games through "Media > Frotz > Games".
- If ncurses is installed, change launcher settings via
  "Media > Frotz > Launcher"; note that the ncurses
  version has screen clearing issues - this is a known
  problem with the terminal module.
- Make sure to read each game's Readmes for understanding
  their commands. Zork-like games use commands such as
  "north, pick up item, open chest", etc.
